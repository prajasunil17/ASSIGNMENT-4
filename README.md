# ASSIGNMENT-4 Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python

**Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors**

For code review view / download a file named `task1.py`

1-First, we Defines a function name of factorial(n)

2-After that, we checks if the number is negative. So the function returns a message instead of calculating.

3-Initializes variable result = 1 This will store the running factorial value.

4-Finally, we return a calculation for result & print the result.

**Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File**

For code review view / download a file named `task2.py`

1- First, we import the complete math module.

2- Inside the `try` block, we take user input as a floating-point number.

3- We use conditional statements `(if-else)` to check that negative numbers are not allowed for **square root** and **logarithm**.

4- For each valid condition, we print the calculation results:

    -Square root : `math.sqrt()`

    -Logarithm : `math.log()`

    -Sine : `math.sin()`
